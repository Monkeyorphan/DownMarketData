The DownMarketData project will look at the relationship between the S&P 500 and the 20+ Year US Treasury Bond. Throughout the history of the US Stock Market, when Stocks have a significant equity drawdown, Treasuries have been a much safer place to put your money. This year, for the first time, Treasuries, the risk-off asset, have had a larger drawdown than the stock market during a significant equity drawdown. This anamoly leads some professionals to believe that something troubling may be coming for the US economy.
Requirement 1: Loading Data - In Visual Studio Code, I read in APIs from https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ using a private API Key. I have hidden that API Key using a .env file and .gitignore so that it is not visible in my commits to GitHub. For the separate Tableau visualization, I found data online and created a spreadsheet that was used to create the side-by-side Bar Chart.
Requirement 2: Combine, Clean & Operate on the Data - I used pandas to clean up the datasets dropping columns, renaming columns, removing rows, converting a column of dictionaries into multiple columns, changing datatypes, etc. To combine datasets, I used an Outer Join merge so that they could be visualized on one chart.
